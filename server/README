Assignment #2, Part #1
CMPUT 275, Winter 2020

Included Files:
	* README
	* digraph.cpp
	* digraph.h
	* dijkstra.cpp
	* dijkstra.h
	* edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
	* heap.h
	* wdigraph.h
	* server.cpp
	* Makefile

Running Instructions:
	1. In the terminal, navigate into the directory containing all included files.
	2. Type "make" into the command line, this will compile the necessary code.
	3. Run the program using ./server

Makefile Targets:
	- make server: builds the server application, which depends on digraph.o, dijkstra.o, and server.o
	- make digraph.o: builds the digraph object file
	- make dijkstra.o: builds the dijkstra object file
	- make server.o: builds the server object file
	- make clean: removes all object files and executables

Notes and Assumptions: 
	This program reads in start and end points from the user and determines the shortest possible path between them using the directed graph provided in edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt. It communicates the waypoints on the path to the client and waits for an acknowledgement before sending another waypoint. 

	This program was built off of starter code provided on eClass, and previous solutions to weekly assignments. Files directly /created by us were dijkstra.cpp, server.cpp, and Makefile.
